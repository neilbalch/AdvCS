100021852@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS. I need YOUR vote to make this an exciting and memorable year for all of us. So remember  Don't pick your nose  Pick Krish!,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Abstain,Jackson Harnett - As the School Board Representative  I will work to further connect the student body with the MVLA school district. I will focus on conveying the ideas and concerns of the student body to the board  no matter how small  and the current projects within the district back to the student body. I am a rising senior  with three years prior experience in ASB  and the current represenative to the PTSA and School Site Council. I have had substantial exposure to the school board throughout my time in ASB  including once serving as a subsitute on the board for the current represenative. My time in ASB has also given me practice working closely and meeting with administration regularly  preparing me aptly to be the School Board Represenative.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!!

Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings.

Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade. These lessons have proven to be valuable and would be a  great addition to the class of 2022 sophomore class cabinet.,Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit.

By incorporating MVHS’s four leadership values; creating an inclusive community  promoting school spirit  celebrating diversity  and accountability to self and community  I will do my best to make sure that that every one of you has a strong student voice that is equally represented and heard. For example through class and congressional meetings and reaching beyond small groups such as ASB or Ambassadors you all have the ability to create positive change. Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color. This year in my position on the Wellness Committee (Spartan Pause) I learned a lot about cultivating healthy stress free environment  which will give me direction into cultivating a good environment in the stress that is junior year.

Go Spartans!,Kelly Smith - Hello my name is Kelly Smith and I am a running to be the ASB Vice President. As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students! Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard.

100022927@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS. I need YOUR vote to make this an exciting and memorable year for all of us. So remember  Don't pick your nose  Pick Krish!,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Jackson Harnett - As the School Board Representative  I will work to further connect the student body with the MVLA school district. I will focus on conveying the ideas and concerns of the student body to the board  no matter how small  and the current projects within the district back to the student body. I am a rising senior  with three years prior experience in ASB  and the current represenative to the PTSA and School Site Council. I have had substantial exposure to the school board throughout my time in ASB  including once serving as a subsitute on the board for the current represenative. My time in ASB has also given me practice working closely and meeting with administration regularly  preparing me aptly to be the School Board Represenative.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year.

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color. This year in my position on the Wellness Committee (Spartan Pause) I learned a lot about cultivating healthy stress free environment  which will give me direction into cultivating a good environment in the stress that is junior year. I have also had lots of other previous leadership experience such as teams  volunteering  and coaching and am very organized.

I will also advise people to wear school colors and attend sports events through social media. Adding on to that  I will make sure all voices are heard and award hard working spartans that deserve recognition. Finally  I will stay organized  work hard  and make sure  student concerns are addressed. I am currently in ASB this year and I have learned a lot from this experience.

100021875@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive.

These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade. These lessons have proven to be valuable and would be a  great addition to the class of 2022 sophomore class cabinet.,Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit.

I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard.

Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here.

Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons.

Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another.

Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade.

100020447@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students!

100020381@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS. I need YOUR vote to make this an exciting and memorable year for all of us. So remember  Don't pick your nose  Pick Krish!,Kelly Smith - Hello my name is Kelly Smith and I am a running to be the ASB Vice President. As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!! Thank you! :),Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit. I plan to encourage student involvement through advertising various events and activities.

I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade. These lessons have proven to be valuable and would be a  great addition to the class of 2022 sophomore class cabinet.,Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit. I plan to encourage student involvement through advertising various events and activities. I also plan to work with the rest of the cabinet to plan exciting class socials and make sophomore year the best it can be!

My experience in ASB has helped with organizational skills and grow as a leader.,Josh Lillie - As Junior President I will serve our class by creating a class identity of inclusion. My goal is for the Junior Class to have “S.P.I.R.I.T.”. This identity will encourage a supportive community  making a celebratory and collaborative atmosphere on campus.

If elected I want to foster a fun  kind  diverse  inclusive and especially spirited community. By incorporating MVHS’s four leadership values; creating an inclusive community  promoting school spirit  celebrating diversity  and accountability to self and community  I will do my best to make sure that that every one of you has a strong student voice that is equally represented and heard. For example through class and congressional meetings and reaching beyond small groups such as ASB or Ambassadors you all have the ability to create positive change. Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color. This year in my position on the Wellness Committee (Spartan Pause) I learned a lot about cultivating healthy stress free environment  which will give me direction into cultivating a good environment in the stress that is junior year. I have also had lots of other previous leadership experience such as teams  volunteering  and coaching and am very organized. Furthermore  I intend to increase support for all student-led activities on campus by using the platform of MVHS Leadership in order to advertise and generate excitement within the student body.. So let’s make junior year one to remember  VOTE CECE FOR VP! :)),Miles Lin - As senior president  I intend to spread inclusiveness and positivity throughout our campus. A year from now  I wish to have the kids who are shy in the back of the classroom to be playing dodgeball with their grade cheering them on. I wish to create an environment where people can showcase  that resonate their individual stories. I want to show the value of diversity and celebrate the successes of everyone  not just a specific group of people.,Kaia Ralston - By running for the senior secretary and treasurer position  I intend to try and make this school a better environment for students by listening to their inputs and making sure they get passed and help make that change. I will promote student bonding outside of school through class socials hopefully make this a more comfortable place for them to be at. I uphold MVHS leadership’s four core values by listening to student suggestions  along with parent and teacher suggestions. I will also advise people to wear school colors and attend sports events through social media. Adding on to that  I will make sure all voices are heard and award hard working spartans that deserve recognition. Finally  I will stay organized  work hard  and make sure  student concerns are addressed. I am currently in ASB this year and I have learned a lot from this experience. I have learned how to step up and take charge in order to get things done during stressful times because I have stayed organized. This will be helpful for the secretary and treasurer because I will be able to organize events well and not stress out while doing so.
100023794@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS. I need YOUR vote to make this an exciting and memorable year for all of us. So remember  Don't pick your nose  Pick Krish!,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students! Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!!

For example through class and congressional meetings and reaching beyond small groups such as ASB or Ambassadors you all have the ability to create positive change. Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color. This year in my position on the Wellness Committee (Spartan Pause) I learned a lot about cultivating healthy stress free environment  which will give me direction into cultivating a good environment in the stress that is junior year. I have also had lots of other previous leadership experience such as teams  volunteering  and coaching and am very organized. Furthermore  I intend to increase support for all student-led activities on campus by using the platform of MVHS Leadership in order to advertise and generate excitement within the student body..

Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard.

On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!! Thank you! :),Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit. I plan to encourage student involvement through advertising various events and activities. I also plan to work with the rest of the cabinet to plan exciting class socials and make sophomore year the best it can be!

My experience in ASB has helped with organizational skills and grow as a leader.,Josh Lillie - As Junior President I will serve our class by creating a class identity of inclusion.

100019962@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS. I need YOUR vote to make this an exciting and memorable year for all of us. So remember  Don't pick your nose  Pick Krish!,Kelly Smith - Hello my name is Kelly Smith and I am a running to be the ASB Vice President. As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade. These lessons have proven to be valuable and would be a  great addition to the class of 2022 sophomore class cabinet.,Abstain,Maddie Connell - Hello Class of 2021! My name is Maddie Connell & I am running to be the Junior class president of MVHS! If I have the opportunity to be the Junior Class President  I will engage the class of 2021 through socials  informative meetings  as well as class bonding events! One of my goals for Junior year is to change the class color  which enables an outlet for student voice and teamwork. I believe a new color could create a powerful canvas to start off the year! I strongly believe that we as a class can work together to cultivate a strong  spirited  determined Junior Class! As many know  Junior  year can bring upon many forms of stress  and I can use my background of being a Wellness Commissioner to help create a positive  and inclusive environment through my efforts as President.,Abstain,Miles Lin - As senior president  I intend to spread inclusiveness and positivity throughout our campus.

100021712@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS.

As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade.

Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons.

Within that committee we have planned a number of activities  such as the Dodgeball  Spikeball  and March Madness Basketball Tournaments  the Haunted House  and a number of Homecoming events. I was a leader of the Homecoming parade committee alongside another leader and a committee member. As for March Madness  I started planning on my own  which was easy  but there were a lot of things I was doing wrong  so with the help of new members I recruited to the committee that I did while considering my thoughts and my advisor’s advice  we did a lot of work together  and I look forward to this event. In and out of ASB  I do a lot of work for school  and for myself. I hope you will consider me as class president. Go Spartans!,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard.

I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!!

Thank you for your support. #SPIRIT #ClassOf2021Juniors,Mason Davies - My mission is to represent the class of 2021 positively by creating a school community that shows school spirit  is inclusive to all classmates  and knows how to have fun. Ensuring that each student feels accepted and heard in their school environment is a major motivator. I aim to make events like rallies  sports games  class socials  and other school events something to look forward to. Lastly  I want to make the general voice of the class of 2021 heard  and allow Junior year to be the best yet.,Miles Lin - As senior president  I intend to spread inclusiveness and positivity throughout our campus. A year from now  I wish to have the kids who are shy in the back of the classroom to be playing dodgeball with their grade cheering them on. I wish to create an environment where people can showcase  that resonate their individual stories. I want to show the value of diversity and celebrate the successes of everyone  not just a specific group of people.,Kaia Ralston - By running for the senior secretary and treasurer position  I intend to try and make this school a better environment for students by listening to their inputs and making sure they get passed and help make that change. I will promote student bonding outside of school through class socials hopefully make this a more comfortable place for them to be at. I uphold MVHS leadership’s four core values by listening to student suggestions  along with parent and teacher suggestions. I will also advise people to wear school colors and attend sports events through social media.

Finally  I will stay organized  work hard  and make sure  student concerns are addressed. I am currently in ASB this year and I have learned a lot from this experience. I have learned how to step up and take charge in order to get things done during stressful times because I have stayed organized.

100022114@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS. I need YOUR vote to make this an exciting and memorable year for all of us. So remember  Don't pick your nose  Pick Krish!,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Abstain,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students! Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard.

Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color. This year in my position on the Wellness Committee (Spartan Pause) I learned a lot about cultivating healthy stress free environment  which will give me direction into cultivating a good environment in the stress that is junior year.

I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Jackson Harnett - As the School Board Representative  I will work to further connect the student body with the MVLA school district. I will focus on conveying the ideas and concerns of the student body to the board  no matter how small  and the current projects within the district back to the student body. I am a rising senior  with three years prior experience in ASB  and the current represenative to the PTSA and School Site Council. I have had substantial exposure to the school board throughout my time in ASB  including once serving as a subsitute on the board for the current represenative.

I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard.

100022793@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be.

Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings.

If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade.

100022480@mvla.net,Abstain,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade. These lessons have proven to be valuable and would be a  great addition to the class of 2022 sophomore class cabinet.,Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit.

By incorporating MVHS’s four leadership values; creating an inclusive community  promoting school spirit  celebrating diversity  and accountability to self and community  I will do my best to make sure that that every one of you has a strong student voice that is equally represented and heard. For example through class and congressional meetings and reaching beyond small groups such as ASB or Ambassadors you all have the ability to create positive change. Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color.

So let’s make junior year one to remember  VOTE CECE FOR VP! :)),Miles Lin - As senior president  I intend to spread inclusiveness and positivity throughout our campus. A year from now  I wish to have the kids who are shy in the back of the classroom to be playing dodgeball with their grade cheering them on. I wish to create an environment where people can showcase  that resonate their individual stories. I want to show the value of diversity and celebrate the successes of everyone  not just a specific group of people.,Kaia Ralston - By running for the senior secretary and treasurer position  I intend to try and make this school a better environment for students by listening to their inputs and making sure they get passed and help make that change.

I uphold MVHS leadership’s four core values by listening to student suggestions  along with parent and teacher suggestions. I will also advise people to wear school colors and attend sports events through social media. Adding on to that  I will make sure all voices are heard and award hard working spartans that deserve recognition. Finally  I will stay organized  work hard  and make sure  student concerns are addressed. I am currently in ASB this year and I have learned a lot from this experience.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Adrien Oueini - As sophomore class president  I intend to make all sophomores feel welcome at MVHS  whether they fit in to modern standards  fit in to their choice of friends  or just be themselves.

I was a leader of the Homecoming parade committee alongside another leader and a committee member. As for March Madness  I started planning on my own  which was easy  but there were a lot of things I was doing wrong  so with the help of new members I recruited to the committee that I did while considering my thoughts and my advisor’s advice  we did a lot of work together  and I look forward to this event.

I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it.

Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today.

I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS.

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year.

My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities).

These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB.

If elected I want to foster a fun  kind  diverse  inclusive and especially spirited community. By incorporating MVHS’s four leadership values; creating an inclusive community  promoting school spirit  celebrating diversity  and accountability to self and community  I will do my best to make sure that that every one of you has a strong student voice that is equally represented and heard. For example through class and congressional meetings and reaching beyond small groups such as ASB or Ambassadors you all have the ability to create positive change. Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color. This year in my position on the Wellness Committee (Spartan Pause) I learned a lot about cultivating healthy stress free environment  which will give me direction into cultivating a good environment in the stress that is junior year. I have also had lots of other previous leadership experience such as teams  volunteering  and coaching and am very organized. Furthermore  I intend to increase support for all student-led activities on campus by using the platform of MVHS Leadership in order to advertise and generate excitement within the student body.. So let’s make junior year one to remember  VOTE CECE FOR VP! :)),Miles Lin - As senior president  I intend to spread inclusiveness and positivity throughout our campus. A year from now  I wish to have the kids who are shy in the back of the classroom to be playing dodgeball with their grade cheering them on.

I want to show the value of diversity and celebrate the successes of everyone  not just a specific group of people.,Kaia Ralston - By running for the senior secretary and treasurer position  I intend to try and make this school a better environment for students by listening to their inputs and making sure they get passed and help make that change. I will promote student bonding outside of school through class socials hopefully make this a more comfortable place for them to be at. I uphold MVHS leadership’s four core values by listening to student suggestions  along with parent and teacher suggestions. I will also advise people to wear school colors and attend sports events through social media. Adding on to that  I will make sure all voices are heard and award hard working spartans that deserve recognition. Finally  I will stay organized  work hard  and make sure  student concerns are addressed. I am currently in ASB this year and I have learned a lot from this experience.

100021825@mvla.net,Abstain,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Adrien Oueini - As sophomore class president  I intend to make all sophomores feel welcome at MVHS  whether they fit in to modern standards  fit in to their choice of friends  or just be themselves. In the years of 2018-19 I am currently a member of the ASB activities committee  which is all freshmen. Within that committee we have planned a number of activities  such as the Dodgeball  Spikeball  and March Madness Basketball Tournaments  the Haunted House  and a number of Homecoming events. I was a leader of the Homecoming parade committee alongside another leader and a committee member. As for March Madness  I started planning on my own  which was easy  but there were a lot of things I was doing wrong  so with the help of new members I recruited to the committee that I did while considering my thoughts and my advisor’s advice  we did a lot of work together  and I look forward to this event. In and out of ASB  I do a lot of work for school  and for myself. I hope you will consider me as class president. Go Spartans!,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard.

Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings.

On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year.

These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year.

Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color.

Adding on to that  I will make sure all voices are heard and award hard working spartans that deserve recognition.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community.

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable.

100023752@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be.

Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB.

100020183@mvla.net,Abstain,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be.

Go Spartans!,Katelyn Lee - I would like to make MVHS a more inclusive community by promoting diversity and acceptance.

My time in ASB has also given me practice working closely and meeting with administration regularly  preparing me aptly to be the School Board Represenative.,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students! Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different.

My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!! Thank you! :),Abstain,Maddie Connell - Hello Class of 2021!

By incorporating MVHS’s four leadership values; creating an inclusive community  promoting school spirit  celebrating diversity  and accountability to self and community  I will do my best to make sure that that every one of you has a strong student voice that is equally represented and heard. For example through class and congressional meetings and reaching beyond small groups such as ASB or Ambassadors you all have the ability to create positive change. Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color. This year in my position on the Wellness Committee (Spartan Pause) I learned a lot about cultivating healthy stress free environment  which will give me direction into cultivating a good environment in the stress that is junior year. I have also had lots of other previous leadership experience such as teams  volunteering  and coaching and am very organized. Furthermore  I intend to increase support for all student-led activities on campus by using the platform of MVHS Leadership in order to advertise and generate excitement within the student body.. So let’s make junior year one to remember  VOTE CECE FOR VP! :)),Miles Lin - As senior president  I intend to spread inclusiveness and positivity throughout our campus.

100020170@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students!

100021819@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Katelyn Lee - I would like to make MVHS a more inclusive community by promoting diversity and acceptance. As Vice President  I would encourage attendance at events like congressional meetings in order to have more representation throughout the school  which would ensure that all students’ voices are heard on issues that matter to them. I have held previous leadership roles as a part of the ASB Dance Committee  as well as being the captain of the golf team  which has taught me strong organizational skills  empathy  and the importance of working with others towards a common goal. As a rising senior  I want to do everything I can to have a lasting impact on Mountain View High School.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Abstain,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students! Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!! Thank you! :),Abstain,Josh Lillie - As Junior President I will serve our class by creating a class identity of inclusion. My goal is for the Junior Class to have “S.P.I.R.I.T.”.

100023672@mvla.net,Abstain,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade. These lessons have proven to be valuable and would be a  great addition to the class of 2022 sophomore class cabinet.,Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit. I plan to encourage student involvement through advertising various events and activities. I also plan to work with the rest of the cabinet to plan exciting class socials and make sophomore year the best it can be!

I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes.

I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

I will focus on conveying the ideas and concerns of the student body to the board  no matter how small  and the current projects within the district back to the student body. I am a rising senior  with three years prior experience in ASB  and the current represenative to the PTSA and School Site Council. I have had substantial exposure to the school board throughout my time in ASB  including once serving as a subsitute on the board for the current represenative. My time in ASB has also given me practice working closely and meeting with administration regularly  preparing me aptly to be the School Board Represenative.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!! Thank you! :),Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit. I plan to encourage student involvement through advertising various events and activities.

My experience in ASB has helped with organizational skills and grow as a leader.,Josh Lillie - As Junior President I will serve our class by creating a class identity of inclusion.

Through these roles  I have become familiar with the school’s systems  allowing me to serve our class with organization and collaboration. I have marched in band  played football  basketball  and baseball  enabling me to enthusiastically represent these and the many other groups on campus.

100024013@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS. I need YOUR vote to make this an exciting and memorable year for all of us. So remember  Don't pick your nose  Pick Krish!,Kelly Smith - Hello my name is Kelly Smith and I am a running to be the ASB Vice President. As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students! Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard.

As for March Madness  I started planning on my own  which was easy  but there were a lot of things I was doing wrong  so with the help of new members I recruited to the committee that I did while considering my thoughts and my advisor’s advice  we did a lot of work together  and I look forward to this event.

Finally  I will stay organized  work hard  and make sure  student concerns are addressed. I am currently in ASB this year and I have learned a lot from this experience.

100020111@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Kelly Smith - Hello my name is Kelly Smith and I am a running to be the ASB Vice President. As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade. These lessons have proven to be valuable and would be a  great addition to the class of 2022 sophomore class cabinet.,Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit.

Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color.

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable.

I have had substantial exposure to the school board throughout my time in ASB  including once serving as a subsitute on the board for the current represenative.

Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another.

Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different.

On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year.

100024357@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community.

As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be.

100019278@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Kelly Smith - Hello my name is Kelly Smith and I am a running to be the ASB Vice President. As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Jackson Harnett - As the School Board Representative  I will work to further connect the student body with the MVLA school district. I will focus on conveying the ideas and concerns of the student body to the board  no matter how small  and the current projects within the district back to the student body. I am a rising senior  with three years prior experience in ASB  and the current represenative to the PTSA and School Site Council. I have had substantial exposure to the school board throughout my time in ASB  including once serving as a subsitute on the board for the current represenative. My time in ASB has also given me practice working closely and meeting with administration regularly  preparing me aptly to be the School Board Represenative.,Adrien Oueini - As sophomore class president  I intend to make all sophomores feel welcome at MVHS  whether they fit in to modern standards  fit in to their choice of friends  or just be themselves. In the years of 2018-19 I am currently a member of the ASB activities committee  which is all freshmen. Within that committee we have planned a number of activities  such as the Dodgeball  Spikeball  and March Madness Basketball Tournaments  the Haunted House  and a number of Homecoming events. I was a leader of the Homecoming parade committee alongside another leader and a committee member. As for March Madness  I started planning on my own  which was easy  but there were a lot of things I was doing wrong  so with the help of new members I recruited to the committee that I did while considering my thoughts and my advisor’s advice  we did a lot of work together  and I look forward to this event. In and out of ASB  I do a lot of work for school  and for myself. I hope you will consider me as class president. Go Spartans!,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade. These lessons have proven to be valuable and would be a  great addition to the class of 2022 sophomore class cabinet.,Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit.

I strongly believe that we as a class can work together to cultivate a strong  spirited  determined Junior Class! As many know  Junior  year can bring upon many forms of stress  and I can use my background of being a Wellness Commissioner to help create a positive  and inclusive environment through my efforts as President.,Abstain,Abstain,Kaia Ralston - By running for the senior secretary and treasurer position  I intend to try and make this school a better environment for students by listening to their inputs and making sure they get passed and help make that change.

I uphold MVHS leadership’s four core values by listening to student suggestions  along with parent and teacher suggestions. I will also advise people to wear school colors and attend sports events through social media. Adding on to that  I will make sure all voices are heard and award hard working spartans that deserve recognition. Finally  I will stay organized  work hard  and make sure  student concerns are addressed. I am currently in ASB this year and I have learned a lot from this experience.

Go Spartans!,Katelyn Lee - I would like to make MVHS a more inclusive community by promoting diversity and acceptance. As Vice President  I would encourage attendance at events like congressional meetings in order to have more representation throughout the school  which would ensure that all students’ voices are heard on issues that matter to them. I have held previous leadership roles as a part of the ASB Dance Committee  as well as being the captain of the golf team  which has taught me strong organizational skills  empathy  and the importance of working with others towards a common goal. As a rising senior  I want to do everything I can to have a lasting impact on Mountain View High School.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students! Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!!

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable.

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students! Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard.

By incorporating MVHS’s four leadership values; creating an inclusive community  promoting school spirit  celebrating diversity  and accountability to self and community  I will do my best to make sure that that every one of you has a strong student voice that is equally represented and heard. For example through class and congressional meetings and reaching beyond small groups such as ASB or Ambassadors you all have the ability to create positive change. Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color.

As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons.

Within that committee we have planned a number of activities  such as the Dodgeball  Spikeball  and March Madness Basketball Tournaments  the Haunted House  and a number of Homecoming events. I was a leader of the Homecoming parade committee alongside another leader and a committee member. As for March Madness  I started planning on my own  which was easy  but there were a lot of things I was doing wrong  so with the help of new members I recruited to the committee that I did while considering my thoughts and my advisor’s advice  we did a lot of work together  and I look forward to this event.

I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors.

I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year.

I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be.

My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable.

Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB.

100020000@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS. I need YOUR vote to make this an exciting and memorable year for all of us. So remember  Don't pick your nose  Pick Krish!,Katelyn Lee - I would like to make MVHS a more inclusive community by promoting diversity and acceptance. As Vice President  I would encourage attendance at events like congressional meetings in order to have more representation throughout the school  which would ensure that all students’ voices are heard on issues that matter to them. I have held previous leadership roles as a part of the ASB Dance Committee  as well as being the captain of the golf team  which has taught me strong organizational skills  empathy  and the importance of working with others towards a common goal. As a rising senior  I want to do everything I can to have a lasting impact on Mountain View High School.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB.

To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Adrien Oueini - As sophomore class president  I intend to make all sophomores feel welcome at MVHS  whether they fit in to modern standards  fit in to their choice of friends  or just be themselves. In the years of 2018-19 I am currently a member of the ASB activities committee  which is all freshmen. Within that committee we have planned a number of activities  such as the Dodgeball  Spikeball  and March Madness Basketball Tournaments  the Haunted House  and a number of Homecoming events. I was a leader of the Homecoming parade committee alongside another leader and a committee member. As for March Madness  I started planning on my own  which was easy  but there were a lot of things I was doing wrong  so with the help of new members I recruited to the committee that I did while considering my thoughts and my advisor’s advice  we did a lot of work together  and I look forward to this event. In and out of ASB  I do a lot of work for school  and for myself. I hope you will consider me as class president. Go Spartans!,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!! Thank you! :),Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit. I plan to encourage student involvement through advertising various events and activities. I also plan to work with the rest of the cabinet to plan exciting class socials and make sophomore year the best it can be! I was apart of ASB last year so I have experience in planning  publicizing and executing many of the events you see on campus. My experience in ASB has helped with organizational skills and grow as a leader.,Josh Lillie - As Junior President I will serve our class by creating a class identity of inclusion. My goal is for the Junior Class to have “S.P.I.R.I.T.”. This identity will encourage a supportive community  making a celebratory and collaborative atmosphere on campus. A few of the things I will do for you next year include having Class T-Shirts available at orientation and increase club involvement with Homecoming Flower Parties and Float building. I also want to hear from you and act on your ideas. S.P.I.R.I.T. Spartan Pride Inclusion Respect In for fun The class of 2021. I have served the school this year as the Sophomore Class President as well as Athletics Commissioner my Freshmen year.

Through these roles  I have become familiar with the school’s systems  allowing me to serve our class with organization and collaboration.

Thank you for your support. #SPIRIT #ClassOf2021Juniors,Mason Davies - My mission is to represent the class of 2021 positively by creating a school community that shows school spirit  is inclusive to all classmates  and knows how to have fun.

I aim to make events like rallies  sports games  class socials  and other school events something to look forward to. Lastly  I want to make the general voice of the class of 2021 heard  and allow Junior year to be the best yet.,Miles Lin - As senior president  I intend to spread inclusiveness and positivity throughout our campus. A year from now  I wish to have the kids who are shy in the back of the classroom to be playing dodgeball with their grade cheering them on. I wish to create an environment where people can showcase  that resonate their individual stories. I want to show the value of diversity and celebrate the successes of everyone  not just a specific group of people.,Kaia Ralston - By running for the senior secretary and treasurer position  I intend to try and make this school a better environment for students by listening to their inputs and making sure they get passed and help make that change. I will promote student bonding outside of school through class socials hopefully make this a more comfortable place for them to be at. I uphold MVHS leadership’s four core values by listening to student suggestions  along with parent and teacher suggestions. I will also advise people to wear school colors and attend sports events through social media. Adding on to that  I will make sure all voices are heard and award hard working spartans that deserve recognition. Finally  I will stay organized  work hard  and make sure  student concerns are addressed. I am currently in ASB this year and I have learned a lot from this experience. I have learned how to step up and take charge in order to get things done during stressful times because I have stayed organized. This will be helpful for the secretary and treasurer because I will be able to organize events well and not stress out while doing so.

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable.

I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB.

Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!! Thank you! :),Abstain,Josh Lillie - As Junior President I will serve our class by creating a class identity of inclusion. My goal is for the Junior Class to have “S.P.I.R.I.T.”.

Through these roles  I have become familiar with the school’s systems  allowing me to serve our class with organization and collaboration. I have marched in band  played football  basketball  and baseball  enabling me to enthusiastically represent these and the many other groups on campus. Thank you for your support. #SPIRIT #ClassOf2021Juniors,Mason Davies - My mission is to represent the class of 2021 positively by creating a school community that shows school spirit  is inclusive to all classmates  and knows how to have fun.

100020485@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Katelyn Lee - I would like to make MVHS a more inclusive community by promoting diversity and acceptance. As Vice President  I would encourage attendance at events like congressional meetings in order to have more representation throughout the school  which would ensure that all students’ voices are heard on issues that matter to them. I have held previous leadership roles as a part of the ASB Dance Committee  as well as being the captain of the golf team  which has taught me strong organizational skills  empathy  and the importance of working with others towards a common goal. As a rising senior  I want to do everything I can to have a lasting impact on Mountain View High School.,Abstain,Abstain,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students! Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade. These lessons have proven to be valuable and would be a  great addition to the class of 2022 sophomore class cabinet.,Abstain,Maddie Connell - Hello Class of 2021!

By incorporating MVHS’s four leadership values; creating an inclusive community  promoting school spirit  celebrating diversity  and accountability to self and community  I will do my best to make sure that that every one of you has a strong student voice that is equally represented and heard.

Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color.

100023108@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Kelly Smith - Hello my name is Kelly Smith and I am a running to be the ASB Vice President. As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Nicole Wagenbrenner - Here at Mountain View High School  we have an estimate of nearly 2 000 students! Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!!

By incorporating MVHS’s four leadership values; creating an inclusive community  promoting school spirit  celebrating diversity  and accountability to self and community  I will do my best to make sure that that every one of you has a strong student voice that is equally represented and heard. For example through class and congressional meetings and reaching beyond small groups such as ASB or Ambassadors you all have the ability to create positive change. Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color. This year in my position on the Wellness Committee (Spartan Pause) I learned a lot about cultivating healthy stress free environment  which will give me direction into cultivating a good environment in the stress that is junior year. I have also had lots of other previous leadership experience such as teams  volunteering  and coaching and am very organized.

As many know  Junior  year can bring upon many forms of stress  and I can use my background of being a Wellness Commissioner to help create a positive  and inclusive environment through my efforts as President.,Cece Duncker - Hello Mountain View Class of 2021! My name is Cece Duncker and I would love to be your Junior Class Vice President/Treasurer! If elected I want to foster a fun  kind  diverse  inclusive and especially spirited community. By incorporating MVHS’s four leadership values; creating an inclusive community  promoting school spirit  celebrating diversity  and accountability to self and community  I will do my best to make sure that that every one of you has a strong student voice that is equally represented and heard. For example through class and congressional meetings and reaching beyond small groups such as ASB or Ambassadors you all have the ability to create positive change. Student voice should not be limited to the group of students in ASB or Ambassadors  rather a collective opinion of all groups and students from campus. Bringing creativity  I promise to think outside the box in order to create a fun spirited environment  through creating t-shirt design this year that won’t be forgotten and inquiring into change our class color. This year in my position on the Wellness Committee (Spartan Pause) I learned a lot about cultivating healthy stress free environment  which will give me direction into cultivating a good environment in the stress that is junior year. I have also had lots of other previous leadership experience such as teams  volunteering  and coaching and am very organized. Furthermore  I intend to increase support for all student-led activities on campus by using the platform of MVHS Leadership in order to advertise and generate excitement within the student body.. So let’s make junior year one to remember  VOTE CECE FOR VP! :)),,
100021892@mvla.net,Abstain,Kelly Smith - Hello my name is Kelly Smith and I am a running to be the ASB Vice President. As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Abstain,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!! Thank you! :),Abstain,Josh Lillie - As Junior President I will serve our class by creating a class identity of inclusion. My goal is for the Junior Class to have “S.P.I.R.I.T.”.

A few of the things I will do for you next year include having Class T-Shirts available at orientation and increase club involvement with Homecoming Flower Parties and Float building. I also want to hear from you and act on your ideas. S.P.I.R.I.T. Spartan Pride Inclusion Respect In for fun The class of 2021. I have served the school this year as the Sophomore Class President as well as Athletics Commissioner my Freshmen year.

Through these roles  I have become familiar with the school’s systems  allowing me to serve our class with organization and collaboration. I have marched in band  played football  basketball  and baseball  enabling me to enthusiastically represent these and the many other groups on campus. Thank you for your support. #SPIRIT #ClassOf2021Juniors,Mason Davies - My mission is to represent the class of 2021 positively by creating a school community that shows school spirit  is inclusive to all classmates  and knows how to have fun.

I will focus on conveying the ideas and concerns of the student body to the board  no matter how small  and the current projects within the district back to the student body. I am a rising senior  with three years prior experience in ASB  and the current represenative to the PTSA and School Site Council. I have had substantial exposure to the school board throughout my time in ASB  including once serving as a subsitute on the board for the current represenative.

If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade. These lessons have proven to be valuable and would be a  great addition to the class of 2022 sophomore class cabinet.,Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit.

100023704@mvla.net,Abstain,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are. Therefore  if I were to be elected sophomore class president  I would want to make each student in the class of 2022 feel valued through not only the school  however  through supporting and cheering on one another. Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB.

My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,Dylan Leahy - If I were to become the sophomore class president I would want to push for promoting school spirit and making the class of 2022 more inclusive. I want to push for school spirit by promoting ASB and non-ASB ran activities to get lots of students at these activities. These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet. With these activities  students will naturally create an inclusive environment because everyone will be rallied around for the same idea. Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus. As part of Freshman Class Cabinet this year we focused on creating the same environment  and I feel qualified to continue what we started to make our class even more spirited and inclusive then before.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard.

Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year.

100021785@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Kelly Smith - Hello my name is Kelly Smith and I am a running to be the ASB Vice President. As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit.

I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community.

Our immense student population ultimately creates a diverse  broad spectrum of students that range from having various interests  ambitions  talents  and different cultural backgrounds that each make us who we are.

Essentially  I would like to build a strong sense of community through a variety of different ASB activities to integrate our class. Moreover  I would help to integrate our class under the idea that we are far more similar than we are different. It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Nolan Neagu - I have impacted the MVHS community by being a part of ASB. As one of the few people in diversity committee  we ran the entire homecoming court and the activities that were a part of it. If I were to win the role of Vice President and Treasurer  I would make sure that the entire sophomore class would come together as a community where everyone accepts the diverse people we are. Having class socials would boost out school spirit and would really show how tight knit the sophomore class can be. At my middle school  Blach  I was a part of the leadership class and helped run most of our activities such as dances  homeroom sports  competitions  and helping out our snack shack run with the success it has today. This experience allows me to have learned ways that a cabinet can run effectively and have the  respect and support of the grade.

These events can be from a homecoming dance and football game to class socials put on by the sophomore cabinet.

Though having other events to promote an inclusive environment is high on my list because our class is so big and I want to get the majority if not all of the class to feel comfortable around their peers on campus.

It would be one of my goals to the shed stigmas regarding the many labels we associate with one another. When we put these labels aside  we find we are far more similar than we are different. I would strive to celebrate and unify under our differences to create a strong sense of community - one that values inclusivity  acceptance and compassion for others.,Bridget Stuebner - My goal is to create an inclusive environment for everyone at MVHS where students’ voices are heard. As the Vice President/Treasurer  I will make it so that everyone feels that they can share their ideas whether it is through my email  class meetings  or talking with you all. I want everyone here at MVHS to be happy and included. I also will create sophomore class T-shirts and help raise awareness for events so that school spirit can be promoted. Every person should be respected and I want to make sure that this is the case here. In terms of past leadership experience here at MVHS  I am the current Freshmen Class Vice President/Public Relations. I have organized events such as flower parties and class meetings. I also run the class Instagram account  @mvhs_2022  and the class Snapchat @mvhs.2022  where I advertise events and often create fliers that are posted on the social media accounts. On the ASB classroom (413/415) windows  I put together the Get to Know ASB posters  and currently I am featuring a freshman each week on the Instagram and Snapchat with their Get to Know ASB information! My current experience in ASB would be beneficial if I am the Vice President/Treasurer because I have experience with Homecoming float building/flower parties and I run the class meetings with the class president  which both of us would be doing again this year. Other things I am a part of at MVHS are girl’s volleyball  Spartan Buddies  and 6th Man Club. I would really appreciate your vote!! Thank you! :),Emma Price - As Secretary/ PR I would help the Sophomore class by promoting school spirit. I plan to encourage student involvement through advertising various events and activities. I also plan to work with the rest of the cabinet to plan exciting class socials and make sophomore year the best it can be! I was apart of ASB last year so I have experience in planning  publicizing and executing many of the events you see on campus. My experience in ASB has helped with organizational skills and grow as a leader.,Maddie Connell - Hello Class of 2021! My name is Maddie Connell & I am running to be the Junior class president of MVHS! If I have the opportunity to be the Junior Class President  I will engage the class of 2021 through socials  informative meetings  as well as class bonding events! One of my goals for Junior year is to change the class color  which enables an outlet for student voice and teamwork. I believe a new color could create a powerful canvas to start off the year! I strongly believe that we as a class can work together to cultivate a strong  spirited  determined Junior Class! As many know  Junior  year can bring upon many forms of stress  and I can use my background of being a Wellness Commissioner to help create a positive  and inclusive environment through my efforts as President.,Mason Davies - My mission is to represent the class of 2021 positively by creating a school community that shows school spirit  is inclusive to all classmates  and knows how to have fun. Ensuring that each student feels accepted and heard in their school environment is a major motivator.

Lastly  I want to make the general voice of the class of 2021 heard  and allow Junior year to be the best yet.,,
100023630@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Katelyn Lee - I would like to make MVHS a more inclusive community by promoting diversity and acceptance. As Vice President  I would encourage attendance at events like congressional meetings in order to have more representation throughout the school  which would ensure that all students’ voices are heard on issues that matter to them. I have held previous leadership roles as a part of the ASB Dance Committee  as well as being the captain of the golf team  which has taught me strong organizational skills  empathy  and the importance of working with others towards a common goal. As a rising senior  I want to do everything I can to have a lasting impact on Mountain View High School.,Abstain,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,Josh Lillie - As Junior President I will serve our class by creating a class identity of inclusion.

100021860@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Katelyn Lee - I would like to make MVHS a more inclusive community by promoting diversity and acceptance. As Vice President  I would encourage attendance at events like congressional meetings in order to have more representation throughout the school  which would ensure that all students’ voices are heard on issues that matter to them. I have held previous leadership roles as a part of the ASB Dance Committee  as well as being the captain of the golf team  which has taught me strong organizational skills  empathy  and the importance of working with others towards a common goal. As a rising senior  I want to do everything I can to have a lasting impact on Mountain View High School.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,Josh Lillie - As Junior President I will serve our class by creating a class identity of inclusion.

As Vice President  I would encourage attendance at events like congressional meetings in order to have more representation throughout the school  which would ensure that all students’ voices are heard on issues that matter to them. I have held previous leadership roles as a part of the ASB Dance Committee  as well as being the captain of the golf team  which has taught me strong organizational skills  empathy  and the importance of working with others towards a common goal. As a rising senior  I want to do everything I can to have a lasting impact on Mountain View High School.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities).

My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,Josh Lillie - As Junior President I will serve our class by creating a class identity of inclusion.

I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Katelyn Lee - I would like to make MVHS a more inclusive community by promoting diversity and acceptance. As Vice President  I would encourage attendance at events like congressional meetings in order to have more representation throughout the school  which would ensure that all students’ voices are heard on issues that matter to them. I have held previous leadership roles as a part of the ASB Dance Committee  as well as being the captain of the golf team  which has taught me strong organizational skills  empathy  and the importance of working with others towards a common goal. As a rising senior  I want to do everything I can to have a lasting impact on Mountain View High School.,Abstain,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Abstain,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Abstain,Abstain,,,,,,,

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP).

The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

100023954@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year.

My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be.

As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Jackson Harnett - As the School Board Representative  I will work to further connect the student body with the MVLA school district. I will focus on conveying the ideas and concerns of the student body to the board  no matter how small  and the current projects within the district back to the student body.

As ASB Vice President I intend to make sure that every single student at our school has a voice. I will be helping to create an inclusive community. Everyone at this school should know that their voice is important and that their voice can be heard. Not only do I want to make sure everyone knows that they have a voice I want to help fulfill different students ideas. Being in ASB this past year has taught me many lessons. I have learned how to work under stress and come up with ideas on the spot after being on the rally and spirit committee. This will help me as ASB Vice President because I will be able to remain calm while talking with a large group of parents and also come up with ideas on the spot to help encourage students during congressional meetings. I believe that if I am elected for this position that I will be able to bring the school together and strengthen our school as a whole.,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be. Go Spartans!,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities. As a part of ASB  I would be able to take advantage of available resources in order to make MVHS a more welcoming and inclusive environment. Through different forms of advertisement and publicity  I would be able to reach out to all different groups of people on campus  leading to more inclusion and increased school spirit. At the same time  accountable records of your ideas for change would allow for changes to be made that would benefit each and every student. I am excited to see the continuous growth of MVHS next year as a community  and to see it fit for each student as an individual.,Sriharini Seshachalam - The types of contributions which I would like to make to the school community focus on erasing social stigma at MVHS  which I believe stops students from participating and is a prime threat to inclusivity. In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community. Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS.

I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance.

I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be.

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be.

As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be.

I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school.

Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance.

100019281@mvla.net,Krish Gujral - Hey MVHS  my name is Krish Gujral and I passionately want to be your ASB President. I have had the honor to serve as Sophomore Class President and Junior Class President over the last two years where I have lead our class through Homecoming Float Building and Battle of the Classes. In addition  I was also a part of the field lights task force this year to convey the student perspective on the issue. Through the course of my last three years at Mountain View  I have been an active member in campus as I have been deeply involved in numerous activities. For example  I have been a part of the Cross Country Team  Basketball Team for the last three years  and an active member of multiple clubs on campus. For this reason  I believe I can represent the voice of a diverse group on campus. My goal  as ASB President  is to create a more inclusive community through listening to the changes that students want and implementing on them so that the students' voices feel heard. Furthermore  I believe I can take school spirit to a whole new level by embracing diversity and pushing for more performances by our talented students at MVHS. I need YOUR vote to make this an exciting and memorable year for all of us. So remember  Don't pick your nose  Pick Krish!,Katelyn Lee - I would like to make MVHS a more inclusive community by promoting diversity and acceptance. As Vice President  I would encourage attendance at events like congressional meetings in order to have more representation throughout the school  which would ensure that all students’ voices are heard on issues that matter to them. I have held previous leadership roles as a part of the ASB Dance Committee  as well as being the captain of the golf team  which has taught me strong organizational skills  empathy  and the importance of working with others towards a common goal.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities).

Through these experiences  I have been able to perceive an assortment of the issues we as members of Mountain View High School need to come together to solve effectively through the consent and inclination of MVHS students.,,,,,,,

My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year.

My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable.

100019447@mvla.net,Abstain,Paris Harrell - Hello MVHS! My name is Paris Harrell and I am running for ASB Vice President this year. Student government has always been something I’ve been passionate about  and for the past three years I have been Vice President/Public Relation officer (something I hope to continue as ASB VP). My past work as VP/PR has given me the experience necessary to make decisions and plan events  as well as the confidence to take charge of situations and make an impact. As ASB VP I will listen to the student voice at congressional meetings and ensure that the administration hears about our issues and can work with us to solve them. The only way we will make a change and an impact at this school is if students take charge of our power  and having a strong and passionate person as ASB VP will make this goal far more achievable. I am  and have been for the past 3 years  interested in making this school a more welcoming  spirited  and engaging place to be. So take this next year into your own hands and vote Paris Harrell for ASB VP!,Erin Coyne - As ASB public relations and secretary of the MVHS student body  I intend to serve students in a way that involves the voices of more people around campus  creates more school spirit  and actively spreads information about future activities.

100019336@mvla.net,Julia Bennett - Hello  my name is Julia Bennett and as ASB president I intend to strengthen our overall school community and school culture. I want to help every student feel that their role at Mountain View is important and valued. Here at MVHS we have a very diverse community and I want to help promote and bring together every student  making them feel that they are safe and needed at school. I also want to work to build school spirit throughout all of our classes collectively  freshmen through seniors. It is important to me to emphasize the importance of every student being a leader  not just the people in assigned positions. I want to help lead and oversee more meaningful events and activities that can enhance our school community. As a person I am very organized and will make sure to keep all events and dates in order ensure a smooth and productive year. Being in the rally & spirit committee in ASB last year has given me a better look at how our school runs and what parts of our school we can enhance. It has taught me a lot about accountability  and especially working with others. I have also worked at countless summer camps through volleyball and my church that have taught me more about leadership and community. I love to talk and work with people and I know that this will be an important quality of a leader. All of these past experiences will help me to be the best ASB President that I can be. If elected I will continue to fight for the students and represent them to make Mountain View High School the best place that it can be.

In order to implement actions which would directly combat the social stigma at MVHS  I will bring awareness to the notion that all four core values of MVHS Leadership are interconnected to each other  which will aid in our school’s aspiration to successfully enforce all students to believe in the importance of engaging with school activities and events  in order to value the welfare of our diverse community. To promote more acceptance of an inclusive community within Mountain View High School  I will work to cease the harmful effects of the toxic social stigma at MVHS by creating more opportunities for students and staff get involved with the events and structure of their school  specifically by creating more ways for MVHS students to express their views and talents at MVHS (i.e. poetry slams  murals / art competitions  plus STEM activities). My previous experiences of leadership include being one of the spokeswomen at the Immigrant Resource Fair conducted at Mountain View High School and a former member of the MVHS Key Club  which conducted me to take leadership by contributing to my beloved community through services  such as by working at the Snack Shack in MVHS and serving as a shopping guide for children whose parents receive low income wage. My prior experiences will help me be successful in the position I have chosen to run for  as I have worked with a variety of individuals and have been placed in a spectrum of situations  which has given me the privilege of listening to what more MVHS students and staff would like to be changed and what they appreciate about our growing community.
